# How to (Probably) Predict the Future

## What This Is
Demetri, you're gonna have to answer this one.


## Style Guide

### General
- Wherever possible, try to follow good-practice naming conventions, such as lower-case file names (e.g. the `fulltext` folder instead of `FullText`).

### Chapters
- Every chapter should be written in a _separate_ `.tex` file, and it should be located within its own folder.
- Chapter names _should not_ have numbers in them. This book is not written linearly and it should be possible to move chapters around arbitrarily.


### Citations
- Every chapter should have a `.bib` file for citations.
