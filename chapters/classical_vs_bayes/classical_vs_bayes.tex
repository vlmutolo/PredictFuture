\chapter{Statistics: Classical vs Bayes}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Talk in this section about probability, and how modern computing is in many ways indebted to probability, see Alan Turing and Enigma code breaking.  
	\item Introduce classical, frequentist statistical thought, and Baye's rule, and how they affect our way of thinking about future events
\end{itemize}
Anybody who wants to delve into the art of prediction would be wise to acquaint themselves with statistics.  This probably is not anything that most have not heard before, and is certainly much easier said than done.  

While Bayesian and frequentist thought are often at odds to say, it is often pivotal for models to consider both fields when making their predictions.
