\chapter[When the Numbers Lie]{Where Math Doesn't Tell the Whole Story}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Can essentially go through every previous topic and show examples of data analysis ``making mistakes''.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item We can make this the last chapter and have it be a \enquote{word to the wise} kind of section\ldots don't put all your faith in stat all the time.
		\end{itemize}
	\item Advocate for predictive analysis to still need human intuition, not just mathematics.  This is something that is easy to explain with financial markets and baseball, but is clearly more difficult to do with the sciences, such as physics or chemistry.
	\item Talk about the limits of mathematical models, how they are not impervious to initial conditions, especially those subject to mathematically chaotic behavior, reference figure \ref{fig:chaos1}. The Python code to create these graphs is included in the appendices.
	\item The most common example is the \enquote{butterfly effect}, often used to help explain why the meteorologists do not always get it right, and how astonishing it is that they can even tell us anything, let alone often give accurate predictions.
\end{itemize}
