\chapter{Quantum Mechancis}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Transition to another science related topic
	\item Talk about probabilistic nature of nature.  We can never really predict \emph{exactly} what is going to happen next, so our best bet is to \emph{guess}, using probabilistic methods.  
	\item Fenyman diagrams, quantum tunneling, probability amplitudes, real world applications such as \textbf{quantum computing}, perhaps its own section.  Schr{\"o}dinger's cat, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, the two slit experiment.  Introduction to multi-verse theory, etc.
	\item Generalize quantum mechanics to a more macroscopic scale, how the models built in quantum mechanics have worked very well in their macroscopic predictions.  Perhaps a section on \textbf{modelling} in general, and how mathematical models are used to explain what we do not know, to predict what is to come, but are not necessarily the end all be all.
